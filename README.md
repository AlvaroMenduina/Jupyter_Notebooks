# Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for **teaching** and **outreach** purposes.

## Introduction to Aerospace Engineering
This folder [here](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering) contains Notebooks used for teaching **Aerospace Engineering** during the summer school **"The Cambridge Tradition"** (Oxbridge Programs) at Cambridge in July 2018. 
- **3 Body Problem**: visualization of a remarkable periodic solution to the 3-body problem published by Chenciner and Montgomery. [notebook](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering/Astrodynamics/3_Body_Problem.ipynb)
- **Escape Velocity**: explanations about the concept of planetary escape velocity and some interesting visualizations. [notebook](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering/Astrodynamics/Escape_Velocity.ipynb)
- **Rocket Equation**: an introduction to the Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation. [notebook](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering/Astrodynamics/Rocket_Equation.ipynb)
- **Two Body Problem** introduction to orbital mechanics in our Solar System. [notebook](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering/Astrodynamics/Two_Body.ipynb)

## Astrophysics
A collection of interesting astrophysics problems that are accessible to everyone:
- **Exoplanet Detection: Transit Method**: an intro to exoplanet detection method via *transit* and *radial velocity* observations. [notebook](/Introduction_Aerospace_Engineering/HandsOn_Project_Exoplanets/Exoplanets.ipynb)

## Optics

## Project_Euler
This folder contains Notebooks illustrating how to solve several problems in the Project Euler catalogue (recreational mathematics) as well as some cool problems / hypothesis / conjectures in Mathematics

## Other
Miscellaneous notebooks including:

- "PSF sampling". A notebook on basic Fourier optics and how the different parameters affect the sampling of the PSF
- "PowerSpectrum Wavefron". A notebook on how the Power Spectral Density of a Zernike wavefront map decays with spatial frequency, and the influence on the RMS
- "Rabbits and Wolfs". A Python script on the game which mimics ecosystems and populations
