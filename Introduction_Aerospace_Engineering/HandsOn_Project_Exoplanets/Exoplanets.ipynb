    "# Satellite science data - Exoplanets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction - the importance of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Every satellite that we send into space has a $\\textbf{mission}$. In the case of telecommunication satellites the mission is to provide communication services; GPS satellites are launched to provide navigation services; Earth observation satellites take care of monitoring our planet (climate change, ocean dynamics, deforestation, etc) and space telescopes are used to study astrophysical phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, these satellites are not just flying around doing nothing. They are constantly generating $\\textbf{data}$ and it is \"what we do with that data\" what justifies the mission in the first place. Therefore, $\\textbf{data processing}$ is an integral part of any satellite mission no matter its particular characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this $\\textbf{Hands-On Project}$ we will learn how scientists treat the data generated by satellites to produce some exciting scientific results. Specifically, we will look into the field of $\\textbf{exoplanets}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exoplanet research\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Exoplanets}$ are planets that orbit stars outside our Solar System. Nowadays we know that there are many of these planets orbiting stars in our Galaxy, and some of them are very similar to our own home planet. This is a very exciting topic because these planets are good candidates for containing some form of life. So in order to look for and characterize exoplanets several space missions have been launched in the past and will be launched in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous one is probably $\\textbf{Kepler}$, a NASA mission launched in 2009 which managed to find over $\\textbf{1200}$ exoplanets\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Kepler.jpg\",width=1000,height=600>\n",
    "$\\textit{Kepler space observatory, a NASA mission to search for exoplanets}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But how did Kepler manage to detect the presence of exoplanets around stars that are many light-years away from our Solar system?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we find exoplanets?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 techniques/methods that can be used to look for exoplanets:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $\\textbf{Transit method}$: this is the one Kepler used. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, it produces a mini-$\\textit{eclipse}$ partially blocking the light. This creates a momentary decrease in brightness which is usually extremely small but detectable with sophisticated instruments. As the planet is orbiting the star at a fixed period, this 'dip' is observed periodically at fixed intervals and can be used to confirm the presence of the exoplanet\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Transit.jpeg\",width=500,height=500>\n",
    "$\\textit{The transit method used to detect exoplanets}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) $\\textbf{Radial velocity method}$: this technique is slightly more complicated to understand but it essentially boils down to measuring the Doppler shift induced by the exoplanet on its host star\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at simulated data of a $\\textbf{transit}$ just like the ones Kepler observed. We will mimic the process scientists follow when analyzing this sort of data, and we will draw conclusions regarding the $\\textbf{size}$ of the exoplanet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by taking a look at the data we will be using"

    "### But how does this help us?\n",
    "Well, all stars including the ones hosting exoplanets have a similar behaviour and have spectral lines. However, because of the presence of exoplanets, stars move around ever so slightly.

    "<img src=\"RV_concept.png\",width=1000,height=600>\n",

    "Consequently we will be able to detect the $\\textbf{Doppler shift}$ of the star because the spectral lines will move back and forth with the same period as the exoplanet. This is called $\\textbf{Radial Velocity}$ measurements and it looks very much like a periodic signal\n",
